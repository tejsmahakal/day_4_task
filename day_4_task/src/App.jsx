In the city, you can't go ten feet without seeing or smelling a restaurant. There are 20 foot high hamburgers up on billboards. I am acutely aware of food, and its omnipresence is astounding." para="Adam Scott"/>
      <Hero heading="Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper." para="Adelle Davis"/>
      <Hero heading="We are indeed much more than what we eat, but what we eat can nevertheless help us to be much more than what we are." para="Adelle Davis"/>
      <Hero heading="Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet." para="Adelle Davis"/>

      <Hero heading="Fat is a barrier, a bellicose statement to others that, to some, justifies hostility in kind. The world says to the fat person, "Your fatness is an affront to me so we have the right  treat you as offensively you appearFat is not merely viewed as another type of tissue

      <Hero heading=" Fat people, it is commonly held, should be punished because they offend our aesthetic sensibilities. They take up too much space on subways, buses, airplanes, and elevators. They consume more than they contribute to society. They become ill and need to be taken care of, or they die early and their families are left unsupported. The only way fat people can gain some acceptance and forgiveness for their crime of overeating is to at least try, or look like they are trying, to lose weight. They must never eat an ice cream cone in public, never be seen eating a normal sized portion of non-diet food!" para="Adelle Davis"/>
      <Hero heading="Tomatoes and oregano make it Italian; wine and tarragon make it French. Sour cream makes it Russian; lemon and cinnamon make it Greek. Soy sauce makes it Chinese; garlic makes it good." para="Adelle Davis"/>

      <Hero heading="Health food makes me sick." para="Adelle Davis"/>
